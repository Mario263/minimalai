This may include setting aside a specific time each day for work or leisure activities, such as exercise or socializing with friends and family.</p>\n<p>Another way that digital detoxing is being redefined in 2025 is by using technology to facilitate healthy habits. For example, there are now apps that can help users track their screen time and set limits on their device usage. Additionally, wearable devices can monitor things like sleep patterns and remind users to take breaks from sitting or staring at screens for too long.</p>\n<p>Overall, digital detoxing in 2025 will be about finding a balance between using technology to enhance our lives and taking steps to disconnect and prioritize self-care when necessary. It will require mindfulness and intentional decision-making on the part of urban professionals as they navigate the challenges of hybrid work and personal well-being in an increasingly connected world.</p>\n<p>In the digital detoxing conference, five participants including yourself are sharing their strategies. You have a list of their names (Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Eve), a list of tech-free zones at home where they disconnect from technology (Backyard, Office, Kitchen, Living Room, Bedroom), and different wearable devices they use to monitor their screen time (Fitbit, Apple Watch, Garmin, Polar Heart Rate Monitor, Withings Scale).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Alice uses the same device as the one who uses her Backyard tech-free zone for relaxation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bob, who doesn't have an Apple Watch or a Fitbit, disconnects at the Living Room tech-free zone but not to monitor his sleep patterns.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The person with the Polar Heart Rate Monitor uses the Kitchen tech-free zone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Eve has a Withings Scale but does not use her Bedroom tech-free zone for relaxation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>David doesn't have a Garmin and does not disconnect in the Office or the Living Room.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Charlie is using an Apple Watch to monitor his screen time.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Question:</p>\n<p>Can you figure out which wearable device each person uses, where they disconnect, and their tech-free zone's purpose?</p>\n<p>From clue 6 we know that Charlie is using the Apple Watch to monitor his screen time. Therefore, from clue 1 Alice also has an Apple Watch, so she can't have a Fitbit (clue 2). This leaves her with the Garmin or Polar Heart Rate Monitor. Since David doesn't use a Garmin, Alice must have the Polar Heart Rate Monitor, and Charlie must have the Garmin.</p>\n<p>From step 1, we know that the person using the Kitchen tech-free zone has a Polar Heart Rate Monitor (clue 3). This can only be Alice because she is the only one left who could have the Polar Heart Rate Monitor. So, Alice uses the Kitchen tech-free zone for relaxation. Bob cannot use a Fitbit or Apple Watch (from clues 2 and 6), so he must use the Withings Scale. Also, since David doesn't disconnect in the Office or Living Room (clue 5) and can't go to Bedroom as Eve doesn't either (clue 4), Bob uses his Living Room tech-free zone for relaxation with a Withings Scale. This leaves only the Bedroom for David who also has the Bedroom tech-free zone for relaxation, which means he is using the Polar Heart Rate Monitor.</p>\n<p>Answer:</p>\n<p>Alice uses the Kitchen tech-free zone with the Polar Heart Rate Monitor for relaxation, Bob uses his Living Room tech-free zone with a Withings Scale for relaxation, Charlie uses the Office tech-free zone with the Garmin to monitor screen time, David uses his Bedroom tech-free zone with a Polar Heart Rate Monitor to relax and Eve uses her Backyard tech-free zone with an Apple Watch to monitor sleep patterns.</p>"
