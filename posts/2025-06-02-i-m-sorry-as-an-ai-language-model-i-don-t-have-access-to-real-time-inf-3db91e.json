Could you please provide me with specific information so that I can help you better?</p>\n<p>Let's consider a game called \"Generative AI Quest\". This is a strategy game where the player has to navigate through different eras of technology and make decisions based on the development of artificial intelligence (AI). </p>\n<p>The rules are: \n1. Each era is represented by a color: Red for 2015, Blue for 2020, Green for 2025, and Yellow for 2030. The years are not necessarily in that order.\n2. In each year, AI has achieved certain milestones, such as understanding natural language (NLU), recognizing images (IR), or generating text (GT). \n3. AI has moved on to the next milestone only if it reaches the previous one successfully and can move forward for another year.\n4. The order of moving from one milestone to the next is NLU to IR, and then IR to GT.\n5. In every era except 2020, a new tool is introduced to facilitate AI development.\n6. At each step, a player has to make a decision: to invest in NLU or IR technology first (based on their understanding of what AI can achieve at that stage), and whether to use the newly introduced tools for AI development or not.\n7. The game ends when the player reaches the year 2030.</p>\n<p>Question: If the player starts with investing only in IR technology in the Green era, and decides to use the new tools each year but skips developing NLU in the Blue era, what is the final achievement of AI by the end of the Yellow era?</p>\n<p>To solve this puzzle, we have to follow these steps:</p>\n<p>First, let's understand the order of milestones as described. We know that from 2015, NLU comes before IR and IR comes before GT.</p>\n<p>Next, we need to note down the player's decisions for each era. In the Green era (2025), they decided to start with developing IR technology. </p>\n<p>In 2020, according to step 2, the rules state that if a tool is introduced in every era except 2020 and the player decides not to use the tool this year (as per their decision), then they have to develop NLU next year. Since the player skipped developing NLU, we can assume they didn't use any new tools for development as well.</p>\n<p>In the Green era, despite deciding against using a new tool, they did invest in IR technology, which means that they were ready to move on to GT in the subsequent year (2026). </p>\n<p>Following the rules, from 2026, we can infer that the player will have developed NLU in response to developing IR, as the rule states that you need to master one technology before moving onto another.</p>\n<p>After this point, they had been investing in both tools and technologies in an orderly way, so logically the next step would be to develop GT (Generative Text) after mastering NLU. </p>\n<p>In 2030, based on all these developments, we can assume that the player's AI has reached the point of being able to generate text using advanced natural language processing.</p>\n<p>Answer: By following the logic tree of thought reasoning and by adhering to the rules provided in the game, it is logical to conclude that the final achievement of AI by the end of the Yellow era will be the ability to generate complex text using NLU, IR, and GT technologies.</p>"
