  "title": "As more people continue to work remotely, maintaining a healthy work-life balance becomes increasingly challenging. This has led to the emergence of a new concept known as \"digital detox\" which involves taking regular breaks from digital devices to recharge mentally and emotionally. In 2025, urban professionals will be redefining digital detoxing by incorporating it into their daily routines in creative ways such as limiting screen time before bed or setting aside specific times for social media use only. Additionally, companies may offer more flexible work arrangements that allow employees to disconnect during non-working hours to improve overall well-being. Overall, the concept of digital detoxing will become a key component of urban professionals' efforts to maintain healthy and balanced lifestyles in the new era of hybrid work.",

Each of them practices a unique form of 'digital detox', which includes reducing screen time before bed, setting aside specific times for social media use only, limiting digital device usage during work hours, spending more time in green spaces, or engaging in hobbies that do not involve screens.</p>\n<p>Your task as a Policy Analyst is to find out the form of 'digital detox' each person follows by using the following clues:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Neither Alice nor Bob limit their screen time before bed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dave spends more time in green spaces than Emily, but less time than the individual who engages in hobbies that do not involve screens.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cindy limits her digital device usage during work hours more often than the person who sets aside specific times for social media use only.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The one who spends less time on social media doesn't practice green spaces or hobbies without screen involvement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bob and Emily both spend similar amounts of time on their devices but differ in how they spend those hours.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alice engages more with her surroundings than the person limiting digital device usage during work hours.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Question: What is each person's unique form of 'digital detox'?</p>\n<p>From clue 1, neither Alice nor Bob limits their screen time before bed. Therefore, this practice must be followed by Cindy, Dave or Emily. But according to clue 3, Cindy doesn't limit her digital device usage during work hours, so she also can\u2019t follow the strategy. So, either Dave or Emily is practicing 'digital detox' of reducing screen time before bed.</p>\n<p>From clue 4, the person who spends less time on social media doesn't practice green spaces or hobbies without screens involvement. Since Bob and Emily have similar device usage but differ in how they spend their hours, it implies that one of them spends more time on digital devices than the other (as both can't follow the strategy of reducing screen time before bed). Thus, neither of them is the individual who reduces screen time before bed (since if they were, it would contradict clue 2 as Dave spends more time in green spaces than this person). This leaves us with only Cindy for the practice of 'digital detox' of limiting digital device usage during work hours.</p>\n<p>Now, since Alice and Bob don't limit their screen time before bed, they must be the individuals setting aside specific times for social media use only or spending more time in green spaces. But from clue 5, we know Bob spends similar amounts of time on devices as Emily but has a different digital detox strategy. Therefore, it means that Emily is the one who limits her device usage during work hours (like Cindy).</p>\n<p>At this point, Alice and Bob are left with the two remaining strategies - limiting screen time before bed or spending more time in green spaces. But from clue 2, Dave spends more time in green spaces than Emily. Hence, it implies that Dave doesn't spend much time on digital devices at all, thus, he is not the one who sets aside specific times for social media use only (since this strategy does not involve a significant screen usage). Therefore, Alice must be the individual limiting her device usage during work hours and Bob spends more time in green spaces.</p>\n<p>Answer:</p>\n<p>Alice limits her digital device usage during work hours.</p>\n<p>Bob spends more time in green spaces.</p>\n<p>Cindy sets aside specific times for social media use only.</p>\n<p>Dave reduces screen time before bed.</p>\n<p>Emily has hobbies that do not involve screens.</p>"
