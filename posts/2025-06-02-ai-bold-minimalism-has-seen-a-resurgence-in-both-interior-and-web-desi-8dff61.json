  "title": "AI: Bold minimalism has seen a resurgence in both interior and web design, thanks to its clean lines, simple shapes, and muted color palettes that emphasize quality over quantity. In interior design, this style often includes open floor plans, exposed brick or concrete walls, and sleek furnishings like leather sofas or metal chairs. The key elements of bold minimalism in web design include a minimalist color palette, clear typography, and simple, easy-to-navigate layouts that prioritize user experience over flashy graphics.
