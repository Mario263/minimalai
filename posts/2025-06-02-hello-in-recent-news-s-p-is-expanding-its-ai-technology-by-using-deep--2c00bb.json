In recent news, S&P is expanding its AI technology by using deep web scraping, ensemble learning, and Snowflake architecture to collect 5X more data on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Previously, S&038;P had data on approximately 2 million SMEs, but with this new system in place, it now has access to 10 million.",
  "excerpt": "This technology is significant for developers because the increased amount of data can be used to improve AI algorithms and machine learning models that are meant to detect fraudulent activities in SMEs. By having more data points, S&#038;P can identify patterns that would have been missed before, leading to better accuracy in detecting fraudulent activities.",

By having more data points, S&#038;P can identify patterns that would have been missed before, leading to better accuracy in detecting fraudulent activities.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this system allows for a more accurate risk analysis of SMEs. The AI technology is able to collect and analyze data from the deep web, which includes sites like social media, blogs, forums, and news articles, providing more complete information on an enterprise's financials, risks, and creditworthiness. This can help lenders make better lending decisions by identifying potential red flags that would have gone unnoticed before.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, this AI technology is a significant step towards improving the accuracy of fraud detection and risk analysis for SMEs. It provides developers with more data to work with, leading to more accurate and reliable AI algorithms. Overall, S&#038;P's use of deep web scraping, ensemble learning, and Snowflake architecture has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach small and medium-sized enterprise lending in the future.</p>"
