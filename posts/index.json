Start with a catchy title that grabs the reader's attention.\n2. Write a brief introduction that provides context and background information about the topic.\n3. Use real-world examples and case studies to illustrate your points.\n4. Break up the text into smaller paragraphs and use headings and subheadings to make it easier to read.\n5. Provide links to additional resources or articles for readers who want to learn more.\n6. End with a strong conclusion that summarizes the main points and leaves the reader with something to think about.</p>\n<p>Consider three AI/ML companies: AlphaTech, BetaSoft, and GammaInnovations. Each company is working on a distinct type of AI technology - deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. </p>\n<p>Based on their recent research breakthroughs, it's known that:\n1. The company developing deep learning isn't GammaInnovations.\n2. BetaSoft didn't make a significant discovery in the field of natural language processing.\n3. The company working on computer vision is not AlphaTech and is neither BetaSoft nor GammaInnovations. </p>\n<p>Question: Can you determine which company is working on which AI technology?</p>\n<p>From clue 3, we know that the company working on computer vision is not AlphaTech, BetaSoft or GammaInnovations. This means by process of elimination, the only option left is to place it with an unknown company named DeltaCorp. \nSo, at this point we can deduce: \n- AlphaTech isn't working on deep learning (clue 1) and isn't working on computer vision (as per step1), so they must be working on natural language processing. </p>\n<p>From clue 2, BetaSoft didn't make a significant discovery in the field of NLP, meaning their project is not with AlphaTech. Since we know that the company developing deep learning is not GammaInnovations (clue 1) and we've established from step1 that it's also not with AlphaTech, by process of elimination, BetaSoft must be working on computer vision.\nSo, at this point we can deduce: \n- The only AI technology left for GammaInnovations is deep learning.</p>\n<p>Answer: AlphaTech is working on Natural language processing, BetaSoft is working on Computer vision, and GammaInnovations is working on Deep learning.</p>"
